This repository contains the studies I have done on artificial intelligence and machine learning. The following topics are covered (details can be found in the respective modules):

## CSC 421/2516 Winter 2019 - Neural Networks and Deep Learning

- Convolutional Neural Networks (see `cnn-arch` module), used for image colorization: finding the correct colors for grayscale images. Derived from [assignment 2](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/courses/csc421_2019/assignments/assignment2.pdf).
- Encoder-Decoder Recurrent Neural Networks (see `rnn-trans-arch` module), used for sequence-to-sequence learning, in particular translation. Derived from [assignment 3](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/courses/csc421_2019/assignments/assignment3.pdf).
- Generative Adversarial Networks (see `image-generation-gan-arch` module), used for generating images and learn style transfer. Derived from [assignment 4](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/courses/csc421_2019/assignments/assignment4.pdf).
- Reinforcement Learning (see `cartpole-rl` module), used for training an agent to balance a pole on a cart, using the OpenAI Gym environment. Derived from [Tutorial 10](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/courses/csc421_2019/tutorials/tut10/policy_gradient_cartpole.ipynb).

## CSC 2541 Winter 2022 - Topics in Machine Learning: Neural Network Training Dynamics

- TBD
