# ai-ml-studies

This repository contains the studies I have done on artificial intelligence and machine learning. The following topics are covered:

- Convolutional Neural Networks (see `cnn` folder). Derived from [assignment 2](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/courses/csc421_2019/assignments/assignment2.pdf) of the Neural Networks and Deep Learning course of the University of Toronto and used for image colorization.
- Recurrent Neural Networks (see `rnn` folder). Derived from [assignment 3](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/courses/csc421_2019/assignments/assignment3.pdf) of the Neural Networks and Deep Learning course of the University of Toronto and sequence-to-sequence learning (e.g, translation).
- Generative Adversarial Networks (see `gan` folder). Derived from [assignment 4](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/courses/csc421_2019/assignments/assignment4.pdf) of the Neural Networks and Deep Learning course of the University of Toronto and used for generating images and style transfer.
